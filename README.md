# Knockout
Sample Page
At the end of my C# course we had a challenge to choose between 4 technologies we were unfamiliar with.
I chose to create an ASP.NET Single Page Application using Knockout.js. I had hours to research it and tackle the challenge. 
I found that as a developer we are faced with new technologies everyday. The ability to research and find the answer is important as we never stop learning.
